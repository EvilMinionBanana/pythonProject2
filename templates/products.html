                <p>Using data, we found that people feel disconnected from their community and house.
                    To fix this, we thought of a much better and easier way to connect with everyone:
                    by Googlyfying! By Googlyfying your house, you give it feelings and a personality that
                    everyone wants to connect with. Imagine the joy you'd feel walking down your street and seeing
                    a row of Googlyfyd houses? We're ecstatic for this!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Prices starting at $1500. We now offer neighborhood bundles up to $45,000.</p>

                    With the Googlyfyd car, your car has feelings and is fun to look at. No one will
                    honk or cut off the Googlyfyd car. If they do, we know where they live! Having a
                    Goolyfyd car makes your imagination a reality.
